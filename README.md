This project is the back-end for the "Stone Sonic" Screwdriver.

The image used for duplication is 128GB and cannot be easily included in the GitHub repository.

## This Repository
* Tracks and documents all software and hardware changes.
* Provide Bittorrent files and magnet links to the current image.
